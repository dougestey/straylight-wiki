<!--more-->

The pipebomb is alive and well in New Eden.

In its first outing flying a new fleet concept based on the legendary Rooks and Kings "Bomb & Blink" theory, REKKINGCREW pilots hatched a perfectly executed plan to decimate an entire fleet of Providence Jackdaws and associated support.

After baiting the enemy fleet with a cyno, RC Rokhs bridged in to a designated location in Providence's home system, 9UY4-H - landing squarely in their warp destination, and killing every single one of them - pods included.
