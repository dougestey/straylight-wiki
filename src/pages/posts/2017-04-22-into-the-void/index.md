New fronts, new pilots and new action. It’s been our most pivotal and exciting month yet.

Unsatisfied with the developments on the Amarrian war front, we decided to shift our focus with an expansion of our area of operations extending to the Stain region.

Thriving in the face of 0.0 without the comfort of a sovereign alliance is no small feat. Our capsuleers have risen to the challenge, uprooting their headquarters, establishing The Villa Straylight,  and settling themselves in record time.

As our numbers continue to grow, with a couple of New Eden veterans joining the fold, we’re still looking for more pilots  – both new and experienced men and women with the right attitude to fly with us are welcome.
